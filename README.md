## Overview

### Mitiq Error Mitigation Tool

Compare and assess quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques using Mitiq's Python package. This project introduces a pipeline, tests, and GUI to evaluate QEM methods' performance and computational overhead across different algorithms and noise models.

### Background

NISQ devices suffer from noise, making computation unreliable. Mitiq, developed by the Unitary Fund, offers QEM implementations. This project creates a pipeline and GUI to compare QEM techniques' performance and computational overhead, aiding users in selecting the most suitable method.
